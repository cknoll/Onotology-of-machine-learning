# Explanations

This file contains explanations for changes to the repository which might-not be self-explaining.

The idea is that for every git-commit which contains such a change, there is some change to this file as well. That change should contain the explanation.

---

## Reasons

- I want to have an easy to overlook structure for the package-repo (with not so many files in the root dir).
- There might be more test-files in the future.
